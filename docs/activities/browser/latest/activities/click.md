(\* For Mandatory)

**Container Requirement:** This activity must run inside an [Open Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/open-browser.md), [Attach Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/attach-browser.md), or [Browser Scope](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/browser-scope.md) container.

## **In the body of the activity**

* **Pick target element**\* - Chooses the element to verify its existence. This activity will generate a string variable (Selector) to specify the location of that element.
* **Click Type** - Specifies the type of mouse click used when simulating the click event. By default, single click is selected.  
  **・CLICK\_SINGLE** - A single click.  
  **・CLICK\_DOUBLE** - Two clicks in quick succession.  
  **・CLICK\_UP** – Releases the mouse button  
  **・CLICK\_DOWN** - Holds down the mouse button.
* **Mouse Button** - The mouse button (left, right) used for the click action. By default, the left mouse button is selected.  
  **・MOUSE\_LEFT** - Sets the action to click using the left mouse button.  
  **・MOUSE\_RIGHT** – Sets the action to click using the right mouse button.

## **Properties**

**Common**

* **Continue On Error (Boolean)** - A Boolean variable has two possible values: True or False.  
  True - allows the rest of the process to continue the execution even an error occurs within the activity.  
  False (default) - blocks the process from continuing the execution.
* **Timeout MS (Int32)**- The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to complete before an error is thrown. If the timeout expires, the activity will be terminated. Default value: 30000 (milliseconds).  
  E.g: 30000

## **Step-by-Step Usage**

1. **Place inside a browser container**: Drag the **Click** activity into the **Do** container of [Open Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/open-browser.md), [Attach Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/attach-browser.md), or [Browser Scope](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/browser-scope.md).
2. **Select the target element**: Click **Pick target element** in the activity body and select the element on the webpage. For more details on element selection and selector optimization, see [Working with Web Elements](/docs/activities/browser/latest/user-guide/working-with-web-elements.md).
3. **Configure properties (optional)**: Select the **Click Type** and **Mouse Button** if different from default.
4. **Run the workflow**: akaBot locates the target element and clicks it.

## **Troubleshooting**

* **SelectorNotFoundException / Element Not Found**: 
  * Ensure that the webpage has loaded completely before performing the action. If needed, insert a [Wait Page Load Complete](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/wait-page-load-complete.md) activity first.
  * Verify that the selector is correct. If the target element contains dynamic attributes (such as changing IDs), open the Selector Editor and replace the dynamic parts with wildcard characters (* or ?).
  * Ensure the target element is visible and not hidden behind overlays or loader animations. Check the **Wait Visible** property.
* **Extension Not Enabled**: Ensure the akaBot Web Extension is active and has permissions to run on the target website. Without it, Studio cannot highlight or interact with web elements.
