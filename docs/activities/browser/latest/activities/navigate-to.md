(\* For Mandatory)

**Container Requirement:** This activity must run inside an [Open Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/open-browser.md), [Attach Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/attach-browser.md), or [Browser Scope](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/browser-scope.md) container.

## **In the body of the activity**

* **URL to be inserted (String)\***- The URL that you want to navigate to in the browser. The URL must be quoted.  
  E.g: "https://www.google.com/"

## **Properties**

**Common**

* **Continue On Error (Boolean)** - A Boolean variable has two possible values: True or False.  
  True - allows the rest of the process to continue the execution even an error occurs within the activity.  
  False (default) - blocks the process from continuing the execution.

**Input**

* **URL (String)**\*– The destination URL to navigate to.  
  E.g: "https://www.google.com/"

**Misc**

* **Display Name (String)** - The name of this activity. You can edit the name of the activity to organize and structure your code better.  
  E.g: [1566898] Navigate To
* **Public (Checkbox)** - Check if you want to public it. Remember to consider data security requirement before using it. Default is unchecked.

## **Step-by-Step Usage**

1. **Place inside a browser container**: Drag the **Navigate To** activity into the **Do** container of [Open Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/open-browser.md), [Attach Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/attach-browser.md), or [Browser Scope](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/browser-scope.md).
2. **Enter the destination URL**: In the **Url** field, type the URL you want the browser to navigate to (e.g., `"https://akabot.com/"`).
3. **Run the workflow**: akaBot navigates the current browser tab to the new webpage.

**NOTE**

* Use the **Navigate To** activity when you want to navigate the current browser window to a different webpage without opening a new browser instance.

## **Troubleshooting**

* **Invalid Browser Session**: If the activity throws an error or fails to execute, ensure that it is running inside an active [Open Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/open-browser.md) or [Attach Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/attach-browser.md) container, and that the browser tab has not been closed.
* **WebDriver Communication Failure**: If the browser driver (e.g. ChromeDriver) has crashed or disconnected, restart your browser session and check if the driver version matches your browser (see the [Environment Setup Guide](/docs/activities/browser/latest/setup-browser-environment.md)).
