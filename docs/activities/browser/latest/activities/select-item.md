## **Step-by-Step Usage**

1. **Place inside a browser container**: Drag the **Select Item** activity into the **Do** container of [Open Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/open-browser.md), [Attach Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/attach-browser.md), or [Browser Scope](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/browser-scope.md).
2. **Select the target element**: Click **Pick target element** in the activity body and select the dropdown menu on the webpage.
3. **Configure the item to select**: In the **Item** property, specify the text value of the item you want to select from the dropdown.
4. **Run the workflow**: akaBot locates the dropdown and selects the specified item.

## **Troubleshooting**

* **SelectorNotFoundException / Element Not Found**: 
  * Ensure that the webpage has loaded completely before performing the action. If needed, insert a [Wait Page Load Complete](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/wait-page-load-complete.md) activity first.
  * Verify that the selector is correct. If the target element contains dynamic attributes (such as changing IDs), open the Selector Editor and replace the dynamic parts with wildcard characters (* or ?).
  * Ensure the target element is visible and not hidden behind overlays or loader animations. Check the **Wait Visible** property.
* **Extension Not Enabled**: Ensure the akaBot Web Extension is active and has permissions to run on the target website. Without it, Studio cannot highlight or interact with web elements.
