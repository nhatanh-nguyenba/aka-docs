**Container Requirement:** This activity must run inside an [Open Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/open-browser.md), [Attach Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/attach-browser.md), or [Browser Scope](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/browser-scope.md) container.

## **In the body of activity**

**Common**

* **Continue On Error (Boolean)** - A Boolean variable has two possible values: True or False.  
  True - allows the rest of the process to continue the execution even an error occurs within the activity.  
  False (default) - blocks the process from continuing the execution.
* **TimeOut MS (Int32)**- The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to complete before an error is thrown. If the timeout expires, the activity will be terminated. Default value: 30000 (milliseconds).  
  E.g: 30000

**Input**

* **Alt (Checkbox)**- Modifier Key.

* **Special Key (Dropdown List)**\* - The key you want to send. A list of all available special keys is provided in the drop-down list.
* **Wait visible (Checkbox)** - A Checkbox has two possible values: True or False.  
  Check (default): the automation will wait for the target to be visible before executing the activity.  
  Uncheck: the automation will not wait for the target to be visible before executing the activity.

**Misc**

**Scroll**: To control how the system scrolls the screen to make the target element visible before performing an action.

* **Horizontal scroll:** Enter a numeric value (pixels) to scroll horizontally.
  + Positive value → scroll right
  + Negative value → scroll left
  + E.g: 200
* **Scroll element to view (checkbox):** The system automatically scrolls until the target element is visible. Default setting is unchecked.
* **Vertical scroll:** Enter a numeric value (pixels) to scroll vertically
  + Positive value → scroll down
  + Negative value → scroll up
  + E.g: 300

## **Step-by-Step Usage**

1. **Place inside a browser container**: The **Send Hot Keys** activity must be placed inside an [Open Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/open-browser.md), [Attach Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/attach-browser.md), or [Browser Scope](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/browser-scope.md) container.
2. **Pick the target element (optional)**: Click **Pick target element** to focus the keyboard shortcut on a specific element (e.g., a search input field). If left empty, the shortcut is sent to the active browser window.
3. **Select modifier keys**: In the body of the activity, check **Alt**, **Ctrl**, or **Shift** if the shortcut requires a modifier key combination (e.g., check **Ctrl** for `Ctrl + Enter`).
4. **Select the Special Key**: Click the **Special Key** dropdown and choose the key to send (e.g., `ENTER`, `TAB`, `F5`).
5. **Run the workflow**: Execute the process. akaBot will send the key combination to the target element or active browser window.

> [!TIP]
> A common use case is to place **Send Hot Keys** immediately after a [Type Into](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/type-into.md) activity targeting a search field, then select `ENTER` as the Special Key to submit the search query.
