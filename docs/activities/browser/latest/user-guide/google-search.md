# Google Search Use Case

> A step-by-step tutorial demonstrating how to perform a Google search and retrieve results using Browser activities.

This guide provides a practical, real-world exercise using **Google Search** to demonstrate web automation. You will build a workflow that automatically navigates to Google, searches for a keyword, extracts the search results statistics, and displays it via a message box popup.

You will use activities such as [Open Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/open-browser.md), [Type Into](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/type-into.md), [Send Hot Keys](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/send-hot-keys.md), [Click](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/click.md), and [Get Text](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/get-text.md) from the **RCA.Activities.Browser** package, alongside **Delay** and **Message Box** activities from the Core package.

## Lesson Overview

* **Use case: Search Google** – Design a standard search workflow on `https://www.google.com/`.

---

## Section: Use Case – Search Google

This section guides you through creating a process to search for `"akaBot"` on Google, extract the text of the search results page, and display it.

### Prerequisites

* Target URL: `https://www.google.com/`
* Input keyword: `akaBot`
* Output: Display search results statistics text via a popup.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Open akaBot Studio and create a new **Process**.
2. Drag a **Sequence** container into the **Workflow Designer**.
3. Drag an [Open Browser](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/open-browser.md) activity inside the **Sequence** container.
   * In the **Properties** panel under **Input**, set the **Url** field to `"https://www.google.com/"`.
   * Select `Chrome` in the **Browser Type** dropdown list.
4. Drag a [Type Into](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/type-into.md) activity inside the **Do** container of the **Open Browser** activity.
   * Click the **Pick target element** link on the activity block.
   * Click on the Google Search input bar on the browser.
   * In the **Properties** panel under **Input**, set the **Text** field to `"akaBot"`.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When performing automated actions too quickly on search engines like Google, the system may trigger bot verification screens (CAPTCHA). To prevent this and mimic natural user behavior, you can drag a **Delay** activity (from the Core toolbox section) immediately below the **Type Into** activity. In the **Properties** panel under **Duration**, set an appropriate pause (e.g., `00:00:02` for 2 seconds) to delay the execution before the next action.

5. Drag a [Send Hot Keys](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/send-hot-keys.md) activity below the **Delay** activity (or **Type Into** activity).
   * Click **Pick target element** and select the Google Search input bar again.
   * Select `KEY_ENTER` from the **Special Key** dropdown list in the activity designer or the **Properties** panel to execute the search query.
6. Drag a [Click](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/click.md) activity below the **Send Hot Keys** activity.
   * Click **Pick target element** and select the **Tools** button on the Google search results page.
   * In the **Properties** panel, set the **Click Type** to `CLICK_SINGLE` and **Mouse Button** to `MOUSE_LEFT`. This action clicks the "Tools" button to expand the search options and reveal the results statistics (e.g., the number of search results and search elapsed time).
7. Drag a [Get Text](/docs/activities/browser/latest/activities/get-text.md) activity below the **Click** activity.
   * Click **Pick target element** and select the search results statistics text (e.g., `"About 775,000 results (0.30s)"`).
   * In the **Properties** panel under **Output**, press `Ctrl + K` in the **Result** field and create a new string variable named `resultsText`.
8. Drag a **Message Box** activity (from the Core toolbox section) below the **Get Text** activity.
   * In the **Properties** panel, set the **Text** field to `resultsText`.
9. Run the process to verify that the browser launches, searches Google, clicks the Tools button, and displays the search results statistics text in a popup.
