## **Properties**

**Common**

* **Continue On Error (Boolean)** - A Boolean variable has two possible values: True or False
  + **True** : allows the rest of the process to continue the execution even an error occurs within the activity.
  + **False** : blocks the process from continuing the execution.
* **Delay After (Int32)** - Delay time (in milliseconds) after executing the activity. The default amount of time is 300 milliseconds.
* **Delay Before (Int32)** - Delay time (in milliseconds) before the activity begins performing any operations. The default amount of time is 200 milliseconds.

**Input**

  + **Element (UIElement)** - Use the UiEIement variable returned by another activity. This property cannot be used alongside the Selector property.
  + **Selector (String)** - Text property used to find a particular UI element when the activity is executed. It is actually a XML fragment specifying attributes of the GUI element you are looking for and of some of its parents.
  + **TimeoutMS (Int32)** - The maximum amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to complete before an error is thrown. If the timeout expires, the activity will be terminated. Default value: 30000 (milliseconds). E.g: 30000
