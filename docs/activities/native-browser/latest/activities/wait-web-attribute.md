* **Pick target element**\* - Chooses the field on a browser to select the item. This activity will generate a string variable (Selector) to specify the location of that field.
* **Attribute Name (String)**\* - The expression of the attribute to be selected from. It is a string, so it has to be encased in quotation marks.
* **Attribute Value (String)**\* - The value of the specified attribute. This property supports String variable so it must be quoted.

## **Properties**

**Common**

* **Continue On Error (Boolean)** - This property specifies when the automation keeps going if it has an error. Only have two possible values: True or False. True - allows the rest of the process to continue the execution even an error occurs within the activity. False (default) - blocks the process from continuing the execution.
* **Delay After (Int32)** - Delay time (in milliseconds) after executing the activity. The default amount of time is 300 milliseconds.  
  E.g: 300
* **Delay Before (Int32)** - Delay time (in milliseconds) before the activity begins performing any operations. The default amount of time is 300 milliseconds.  
  E.g: 300
* **Timeout MS (Int32)** - The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run. If the timeout has expired, the page would not be loaded further. The default amount of time is 30000 milliseconds.  
  E.g: 30000
