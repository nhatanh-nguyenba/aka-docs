    * **SecurityToken** - The security token of the user whose credentials are used to log into Salesforce, stored in a SecureString variable encrypted by using the **Microsoft .NET Data Protection API** (DPAPI) and stored in the workflow file itself. Only SecureString variables supported. This property is optional, depending on the settings of your Salesforce Organization.
