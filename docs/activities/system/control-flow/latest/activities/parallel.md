System.Activities.Statements.Parallel

## **Description**

This activity allows you to execute multiple child activities simultaneously and asynchronously.  
When the activity runs, a separate job is created for each child activity.

If a child process is invoked but not found, an error is logged with the process name.  
If an error occurs within a child process after it has started, the parent process is not affected and continues execution.
