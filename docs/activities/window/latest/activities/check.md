## **Properties**

* **Continue On Error (Boolean)**-A Boolean variable has two possible values: True or False  
  - True: allows the rest of the process to continue the execution even an error occurs within the activity.  
  - False: blocks the process from continuing the execution.
* **TimeOut MS (Int32)**- The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait for the activity to run. The default amount of time is 30000 milliseconds.  
  E.g: 30000
* **Delay After (Int32)** - Delay time (in milliseconds) after executing the activity.  
  E.g: 300
