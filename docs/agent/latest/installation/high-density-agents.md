# Setting Up Windows Server for High-Density Agents

If you want to take advantage of the **High-Density Agents** feature on a Windows Server machine, you must first make some configuration changes to it. These steps are split into the following:

1. Install Remote Desktop Session Host to enable the Windows Server machine users to access virtual desktops, session-based desktops, and RemoteApp programs.
2. Add the users that are going to use the machine (and are going to be used as Agents).

## **1. Install Remote Desktop Session Host**

1. Open Server Manager.
2. In the **Dashboard** panel, click **Add roles and features**. The **Add Roles and Features Wizard** is displayed.
3. Follow the wizard (click **Next**) until you reach the **Select Server Roles** step.
4. In the **Roles** section, select the **Remote Desktop Services** option and click **Next**.

       5. Follow the wizard until you reach the **Select Role Services** step, without changing the displayed settings.

       6. In the **Role Services** section, select the **Remote Desktop Session Host** option. A dialog box is displayed prompting you regarding some required features.

       7. Click **Add Features**. You are returned to the wizard.

       8. Follow the wizard until the **Confirm Installation Selections** step and click **Install**. The feature is installed (restarting the server might be required).

## **2. Adding Users**

You need to add the users that can connect to that machine (they do not need administrator rights). These users are the ones that are also going to be used as Agents.

1. Open **Computer Management**.
2. In the left panel, navigate to **Computer Management (Local) > Local Users and Groups > Groups**. The right panels are updated accordingly.
3. Double-click **Remote Desktop Users**. The **Remote Desktop Users Properties** window is displayed.
4. Click **Add**. The **Select Users, Computers, Service Accounts, or Groups** window is displayed.
5. In the **Enter the object name to select** field, add users from your domain, under which the Agents will be able to access the machine.
6. Click **OK**. The configuration is saved and the **Select Users, Computers, Service Accounts, or Groups** window closes.
7. In the **Remote Desktop Users Properties** window, click **Apply** and **OK**. Your settings are saved and the users you just added will now be able to login to the Windows Server machine.
