# Akabot Agent

Akabot Agent is the runtime component that lives on a machine — desktop or server — and executes automation workflows dispatched by Akabot Center or triggered locally. Agents can run attended (alongside a human user) or unattended (fully automated, 24/7).

## Agent types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Attended** | Runs on a user's desktop and can interact with the currently logged-in session. Triggered manually or by a hotkey. |
| **Unattended** | Runs on a server or VM without a human present. Triggered remotely by Akabot Center. |
| **Testing** | Used for local development and debugging. Not counted toward your license. |

## Key features

- **Lightweight runtime** — Minimal footprint; runs as a Windows service or user-mode process.
- **Secure channel** — All communication with Akabot Center is encrypted and token-authenticated.
- **Automatic updates** — Agents pull workflow package updates from Center before each run.
- **Local triggers** — Agents can be triggered by file system events, keyboard shortcuts, or REST calls.
- **Cognitive capabilities** — Integrates with Akabot Vision and AI models for intelligent document processing and decision-making.
