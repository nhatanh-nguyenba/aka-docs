**Known Issues and Limitations**

There are a few things to consider when using the Picture-in-Picture feature:

* If you are using a PIN to log into the main Windows session, you are asked for your credentials every time you start a Picture-in-Picture session.  
  The above only applies to using a PIN. When a password is used, it is automatically saved for authenticating future Picture-in-Picture sessions.
* When the Picture-in-Picture session is opened, start-up programs open in the PiP session as well. Because of this, it is possible that some settings for peripheral devices to be reset to their default values (such as lighting settings for keyboard and mouse).
* If you enable the Remote Desktop Session when the prompt appears while running a PiP Process, you need to log out and log back in the main Windows Session for the changes to take effect.
* The machine cannot be restarted or shut down while the PiP session is opened as the PiP session needs to be closed beforehand.
* Due to Operating System limitations for running Picture-in-Picture, Home Editions of Windows 8 and 10 are not supported.
* The clipboard is shared between the PiP session and the main session.
* Run as administrator cannot be used in the PiP session.
* Only one Picture-in-Picture session can be started at a time

### **3. Stop a process**

While a process is running, you can stop it manually by clicking "Stop" symbol   
After stopped, robot status turns to be Available and all related programs while running will be closed.
