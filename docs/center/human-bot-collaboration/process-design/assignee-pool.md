# Assignee Pool

An Assignee Pool is a named group of users who are eligible to perform human tasks within a process. Instead of assigning a human task to a single individual, you can assign it to a pool, and any member of that pool can claim and complete the task. This approach improves process resilience by preventing bottlenecks that occur when a specific individual is unavailable, on leave, or overloaded with work.

Assignee Pools are defined at the system level and reused across multiple processes and human tasks. Each pool has a name, an optional description, and a list of user members. Membership can be managed manually by an administrator or synchronized automatically with your organization's directory service (LDAP/Active Directory). When a human task is assigned to a pool, all pool members receive a notification and the task appears in each member's inbox. The first member to claim the task locks it, preventing duplicate processing.

Pools can also be configured with a **load balancing** strategy, where the system automatically routes the task to the pool member with the fewest active assignments. This ensures a fair distribution of work and reduces overall task completion time. Supervisors can view pool-level statistics — including average handling time and pending task count — from the Collaboration Center dashboard.

## Pool Assignment Strategies

| Strategy | Description | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| First Claim | Any pool member can claim the task from their inbox | General approval tasks |
| Round Robin | Tasks are assigned sequentially to pool members in rotation | Equal workload distribution |
| Load Based | Task is routed to the member with the fewest active tasks | High-volume queues |
| Skill Based | Task is routed based on member skill tags | Specialized processing tasks |
| Manual Override | Supervisor manually assigns the task to a specific member | Escalated or sensitive tasks |
