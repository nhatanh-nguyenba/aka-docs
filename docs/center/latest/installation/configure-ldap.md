# Configure akaBot Center to use LDAP for authentication

This document provides instructions for configuring LDAP/AD authentication within the system.

# **1. Overview**

# - Open file **application-prod.yml** file

- An example setting and formatting Configuration properties in the file: Setting for login of users in FSOFT

# **2. Setting Configuration properties ldap-server-list**

The system supports multiple LDAP/AD server configurations. Each server in the list must define the following properties:

|  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Key Name** | **Value of name** | **Description** | **Value example** |
| ldap-server-list |  | List of LDAP/AD server. |  |
| configurations |  | Key description list of server LDAP/AD. |  |
| name | Character | Name or label of server. |  FSOFT  |
| enable | True or False | Only True or False to set enable or disable server. | True |
| url | Character | Ip address or DNS name of server. Always include  ldap://  isprefix. |  ldap://fsoft.fpt.vn  |
| port | Number | Port number of url server | 389 |
| timeout | Number or character | Limit milliseconds when Center connection to server without receive response data | 60000 |
| baseDn | Character | A list of baseDn. A baseDn is typeof search base settings in the standard format: ou=organizational unit,dc=first part of distinguished server name,dc=any part of the distinguished server name that appears after the dot.  A baseDN can set relative at the high level of LDAP tree. | - "OU=FSOFT CO,DC=fsoft,DC=fpt,DC=vn" |
| userDn | Character | A list of userDn. An userDn is  distinguished name of searching User in the standard format:dn=account name | -  cn   -  uid  |
| prefixMailIsUserDn | True or False | Only True or False. If set True then userDn=prefix of email. Set False then when user input an email to login, the userDn=email user login. | True |
| authenticationType | Character | Type of authentication.  Current only support Simple authentication. |  Simple  |
| emailUserMapping | Character | Key email attribute of user LDAP. Email of user LDAP will be mappedto email of user system. |  mail  |
| firstNameUserMapping | Character | Key first name attribute of user LDAP. First name of user LDAP will be mapped to firstName of user system. |  givenName  |
| lastNameUserMapping | Character | Key last name attribute of user LDAP. Last name of user LDAP will be mapped to lastName of user system. |  cn  |
| passwordUserDefault | Character | Password default set for new user sync from user login via LDAP. |  secret@Akabot  |
| masterUserDn | Character | Setting an user, is called  master  for searching in LDAP tree, this is setting DN name of master user |  cn  |
| masterUserDnValue | Character | DN value of master user |  admin  |
| masterUserPassword | Character | Password of master user |  secretAdmin  |
| masterBaseDn | Character | Absolute path DN to master user | "ou=system,dc=Company, dc=vn" |

# **3. Make real setting LDAP/AD Configuration properties**

**Step 1: Stop Services**

- Open **Services**

- Stop the **Apache Tomcat** service before making changes.

**Step 2: Use Active Directory Administrative Center tool to get information for setting ldap-server-list**

- Open Start menu => Windows Administrative tools => Open **Active Directory Administrative Center** tool

![1773907432579-484.png](/img/1773907432579-484.png)

- Assume that we have had an AD/LDAP already with many users in the Users distinguished name. Get value of **distinguishedName** to fill in the baseDn:

![1773907511728-165.png](/img/1773907511728-165.png)

**Step 3: Get values to fill in value of userDn, emailUserMapping, firstNameUserMapping, flastNameUserMapping:**

![1773907593968-692.png](/img/1773907593968-692.png)

**Step 4: Get values to fill in value of masterUserDn, masterUserDnValue and masterBaseDn**

![1773907657385-440.png](/img/1773907657385-440.png)

![1773907673752-986.png](/img/1773907673752-986.png)

- You should set default as example table for other values of ldap-server-list setting.

- Save the setting file after finish.

**Step 5: Start Apache Tomcat service**

- Open Service

- Start Apache Tomcat

# **4. LDAP/AD User Authentication: Standard Conditions and Exceptional Cases**

**4.1. Standard Conditions for LDAP/AD User Mapping**

To successfully map an LDAP/AD user to the RPA system, the following conditions must be met:

* **Email Attribute:** The LDAP user must have a valid email attribute, or their Distinguished Name (DN) must be an email address.
* **Single Email:** The LDAP user should have one, and only one, email attribute defined.
* **Validity & Uniqueness:** The email must be valid and unique within the LDAP organization.
* **System Uniqueness:** The email must not already exist in the RPA system prior to the user's first login.

**4.2. Exceptions and Limitations (Abnormal Cases)**

* **Duplicate Login Names:** If a new LDAP user has the same login name as an existing system user, the new account will be created using the format: [login\_name]\_[id\_number].
* **Authentication Methods:** Currently, the system only supports the **Simple Authentication** method. Other methods are not yet supported.
* **Security Constraints:** Configuration with **SSL (LDAPS)** for AD/LDAP servers is not yet supported.
