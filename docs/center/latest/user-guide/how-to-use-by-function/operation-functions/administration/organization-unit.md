# Organization Unit

**Organization Units (OU)** provide the separation of Orchestrator components into tenants for designated users. The user's perspective of akaBot Center is determined by the organization unit in which they are placed, as well as the role(s) appointed to them. The following categories of entities make up an organization unit:

* Agent group
* Agents
* Workflows
* Tasks
* Schedules
* Packages Repository
* Assets
* Queue
* Logs
* Report  
  ! Statistics are produced for each organizational unit and shown on the Dashboard.

**Notes:**  
A user with no assigned Organization Unit does not have access to any type of resources.  
The same agent cannot be provisioned on two different Organization Units. Resources cannot be moved from one organization unit to another.  
A drop-down list displays all of the units assigned to a user located at the header of the page, available at all times. User can also use this to switch between OU.
