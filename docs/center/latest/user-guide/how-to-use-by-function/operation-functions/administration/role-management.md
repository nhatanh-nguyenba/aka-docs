# Role Management

akaBot incorporates a role and permission-based access-control framework. Roles are sets of permission, which means that the permissions required to access and control specific Center resources are assigned to roles. In other words, Users were not given permission to certain resources but will get the permit through a role. Depending on their roles, users have access to the resources listed below:

| No | Resource |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | ADMIN RESOURCE |
| 2 | ENVIRONMENT RESOURCE |
| 3 | ROBOT RESOURCE |
| 4 | PACKAGE RESOURCE |
| 5 | WORKFLOW RESOURCE |
| 6 | JOB RESOURCE |
| 7 | SCHEDULE RESOURCE |
| 8 | ORGANIZATION UNIT RESOURCE |
| 9 | ASSET RESOURCE |
| 10 | QUEUE RESOURCE |
| 11 | LOG RESOURCE |

| Permissions | Category |
| --- | --- |
| None | Users won’t see the resource in the Center interface. |
| View | Users can see the resources but can’t interact with it. |
| Edit | Users can see and edit the resources. |
| Create | Users can see and create new resources. |
| Delete | Users can delete the resources. |

This Role Management page displays all available roles and allows admin to add or delete, as well as update roles’ information. After selecting the **Role Management** tab, the system displays the following page:
