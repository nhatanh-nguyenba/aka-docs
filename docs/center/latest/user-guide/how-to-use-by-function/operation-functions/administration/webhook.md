# Webhook

Webhooks allow you to integrate your akaBot Platform with your whole application ecosystem more effectively. You may subscribe to Center events and forward them to any external DCM, BPM, or CRM solution to notify various users, such as when a new queue item is ready for processing, a trigger fails, or a process is changed.

Notes: Your application must be web-hooked and compatible with akaBot.

After selecting the **Webhook** tab, the system displays the following page.
