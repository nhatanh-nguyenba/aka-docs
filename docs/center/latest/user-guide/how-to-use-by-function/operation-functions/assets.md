# Assets

**Assets** usually represent shared variables or credentials that can be used in different automation projects. They allow you to store specific information so that the Robots can easily have access to it.

Additionally, an extra level of security is provided, as all credentials stored here are encrypted with the AES 256 algorithm. They can be invoked by RPA developers when designing a process, but their values can be hidden from them. The **Assets** page enables you to create new assets. It also displays all previously created assets, which can  
be edited or deleted.

To access the **Asset** page, you click **Assets** tab in the left menu. After clicking, the system opens an **Asset Listing** where all the Assets are located.
