A Package in akaBot Center is the deployable unit of automation — the compiled output of an automation project created in akaBot Studio. When a developer finishes building and testing an automation in Studio, they publish it as a NuGet-format package file (.nupkg), which is then uploaded to akaBot Center. Center stores and manages all published packages in its Package Library, enabling version control, rollback, and controlled deployment of automation logic across the organization.

**Package** page displays all the projects published from akaBot Studio, as well as the ones that were manually uploaded. A project becomes a package when it is published to akaBot Center.

To access the **Package** page, you click the **Package** tab in the left menu. After clicking, the system opens the **Package Listing** page that includes all **Packages** we have published to the Center.
