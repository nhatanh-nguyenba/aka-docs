Scheduling allows us to perform tasks in a preplanned way. You can execute tasks by commanding Agents to perform different schedules and times according to your needs. The Schedule page enables us to create new schedules. It also displays all previously created schedules, which can be further edited, enabled, or disabled. To access the Schedule page, click the Schedule tab in the left menu. After clicking, the system opens the Schedule Listing page that included all schedules we have created previously.
