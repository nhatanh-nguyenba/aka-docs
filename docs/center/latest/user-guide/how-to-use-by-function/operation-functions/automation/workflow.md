# Workflow

A **Workflow** represents the association between a **Package** and an **Agent Group**. Each time a package is linked to an **Agent Group**, it is automatically distributed to all the Agent machines that belong to that **Agent Group**.

The Workflows page enables you to deploy an uploaded package to Agent Groups, manage previously created associations and keep all your workflows up to date. This helps you distribute packages on the Agent machines and execute works faster from the Tasks page. To access the Workflows page, you click the Workflow tab at the left menu. After clicking, the system shows the Workflow page listing all existed Workflow as below:
