# Queue

A **Queue** in simple terms is a container that holds a set of items that you want to be processed by akaBot Agents. Queue items can store different types of data, such as customer details. This information can be processed in other systems - SAP or Salesforce, for instance.

Queues enable you to create large automation projects underlined by complex logic. New queues created in **akaBot Center** are empty by default. To populate queues with items, to change their status and process them, you have to use Studio activities. As soon as queue items are processed, they become transactions. To access the **Queue** page, you click **Queue** tab in the left menu. After clicking, the system opens **Queue Listing Page** where all the **Queues** are located.
