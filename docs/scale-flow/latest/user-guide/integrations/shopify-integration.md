# Shopify Integration

Connecting Shopify allows ScaleFlow to access your e-commerce store's data, such as products, orders, and customer information. This enables your AI Agents to retrieve real-time data to answer customer inquiries or automate tasks.

To connect Shopify, you will need your Shopify **Store URL**, a **Client ID**, and a **Client Secret** (API secret key) generated from a Shopify Custom App.

## **Before you start**

Make sure you have:

- A Shopify store with an active plan.
- Administrator access to the Shopify admin dashboard of the store.
- Permission in ScaleFlow to manage integrations.

## **Quick troubleshooting**

### Error: Invalid Store URL

- Ensure you entered the `.myshopify.com` domain. Do not use your custom domain (like `www.mycustomdomain.com`) unless specified.
- Do not include `https://`, `http://`, or `/admin` in the field.

### Error: Unauthorized or Connection Failed

- Check that your Redirect URLs in Shopify Partners match ScaleFlow's callback URL exactly.
- Verify that you copied the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** correctly from the App Settings page in Shopify Partners.
- **Check if you have ticked the "Use legacy install flow" checkbox**: Go to the **Versions** tab, scroll to the **Access** section, and verify that the **Use legacy install flow** checkbox is checked (Step 2, sub-step 8). If this option is not checked, the installation redirect will fail.

### Error: Data Synchronization Failures (Missing Customer or Order Details)

- **Check if you have requested access**: Ensure that you went to **API access requests** -> **Protected customer data access** and clicked **Request access** (Step 2, sub-steps 5 & 6).
- **Check data reasons selection**: Verify that you clicked the **Select** button under **Protected customer data**, checked **Customer service** and **App functionality**, and clicked **Save** to apply the configuration.
- If using a developer store or Custom distribution, ensure you have selected your data reasons so the data can be accessed without a formal App Store review submission.
