# Tenant Management

A tenant is your company's ScaleFlow workspace. It is the shared space where your users, channels, AI setup, conversations, contacts, and tickets belong.

Most users do not need to manage tenant settings every day. This page is mainly for workspace owners and admins.

## What Tenant Management is used for

In **Organization -> Tenant Management**, you can:

- View workspace identity details.
- View owner information.
- Update **Company Name** if you have permission.
- Review workspace status.
- Copy IDs when support asks for them.

An ID is a unique code ScaleFlow uses to identify your workspace. You usually only need it when contacting support.

If the page is read-only or blocked, ask your admin to review your organization access.

## Open Tenant Management

![Tenant Management overview](/img/tenant-manage.png)

1. In the left sidebar, open **Organization**.
2. Select **Tenant Management**.
3. You will see two information cards:
   - **Identity**
   - **Ownership**

## Understand the information on screen

### Identity

You can review:

- **Tenant Name** (read-only)
- **Tenant ID** (read-only, copy icon available)
- **Company Name**
  - Editable when you have management access
  - Read-only when you do not

### Ownership

You can review:

- **Owner Email** (read-only)
- **Owner ID** (read-only, copy icon available)
- **Status** badge:
  - `Active`
  - `Pending`
  - `Disabled`

### Dates

At the bottom of the page, you can review:

- **Created At**
- **Updated At**

These are informational fields and cannot be edited.

## Update Company Name

1. In the **Company Name** field, enter the new value.
2. Click **Save**.
3. Wait for the success notification: **Tenant updated successfully**.

If the update fails, you will see: **Failed to update tenant**.

## Discard changes

If you changed **Company Name** but do not want to save:

1. Click **Discard Changes**.
2. The field resets to the latest saved value from the server.

## Real-world example

Your company changes its public brand name from "ABC Services" to "ABC Care". The workspace owner opens Tenant Management, updates **Company Name**, and saves it so the organization information stays current.

## How this connects to other setup pages

- Use [User Management](./user-management) to add people to the workspace.
- Use [Team Management](./team-management) to organize staff.
- Use [Roles & Permissions](./roles-permissions) to control access.
- Use [Channel Integration](./channel-integration) to connect customer message channels.

## Notes

- This page does not create or delete tenants.
- Only **Company Name** is editable from this screen.
- Save and discard action buttons are shown only to users with management access.
- Copy icon appears for ID fields to help when support asks for workspace details.

## Troubleshooting

### I cannot see Tenant Management in Organization

- Ask your admin to grant tenant view access.

### I can open the page but cannot edit anything

- You likely have view-only access.
- Ask your admin for tenant management access if updates are required.

### I clicked Save but changes are not visible

- Wait a few seconds for data refresh.
- Reopen the page or refresh the browser.
- Confirm that the success message appeared after saving.

### I see "Failed to load tenant information."

- Refresh the page and try again.
- If the issue continues, contact support and share the Tenant ID if available.
