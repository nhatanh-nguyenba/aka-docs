# ST-MRD-009 - Deeply Nested Activities

**Rule ID:** ST-MRD-009

**Scope:** Workflow

## Description

The rule checks whether any activity is nested too deeply within other activities for maintainability and readability reasons. The default threshold is 7.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to reduce the nesting depth by refactoring the workflow into multiple smaller, reusable workflows.

## Parameters

*   **Threshold:** The maximum number of nested activities allowed. Default value: `7`.

This means that if the Workflow Analyzer finds at least 7 nested activities, a message is logged in the Error List. You can modify the threshold value (e.g., to 3), and the rule will log an error message only if the number of nested activities surpasses the new threshold.

### Reset to Default Value

To reset the value to default, right-click the rule in the Analyzer window, and then click **Reset to default**.
