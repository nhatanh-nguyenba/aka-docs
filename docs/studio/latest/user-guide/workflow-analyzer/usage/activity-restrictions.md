# ST-USG-026 - Activity Restrictions

**Rule ID:** ST-USG-026

**Scope:** Activity

## Description

The rule checks whether any restricted activities are used in the project. Restricted activities are defined by Prohibited Activities or Allowed Activities lists.

* **Prohibited Activities** - Activities that are not allowed in the project. All activities that are not on this list can be used in the project.
* **Allowed Activities** - Activities that are allowed in the project. Only the activities that are on this list can be used in the project.

## Recommendation

Ensure the activity is allowed by the organization's policy or replace it with an approved alternative

## Modifying the Rule

In the ribbon, click the **Analyze** button dropdown and select **Analyze Settings** to open the Analyzer window. Find and select the rule, and then define the restricted activities using either the **ProhibitedActivities** list or the **AllowedActivities** list. When modifying the rule:

* Add the namespaces of the activities (for example `RCA.Activities.Common`) separated by comma (`,`).
* You can use the asterisk (`*`) wildcard character at the beginning or at the end of each entry. For example, adding `RCA.Activities.Common.*` to the list of prohibited activities means that no activity with a namespace that starts with `RCA.Activities.Common` is allowed.
* **IMPORTANT:** Do not use the lists concurrently. If both lists are populated, the list of prohibited activities takes precedence.

## Reset to Default

By default, the rule does not restrict the use of any activity. To reset the rule to default, right-click it in the Analyzer window, and then click **Reset to default**.
